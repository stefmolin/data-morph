Data Morph in the classroom
---------------------------

Data Morph is intended to be used as a teaching tool to illustrate the importance
of data visualization. Here are some potential classroom activities for instructors:

* **Statistics Focus**: Have students pick one of the `built-in datasets
  <./api/data_morph.data.loader.html#data_morph.data.loader.DataLoader>`_
  and morph it into all available target shapes. Ask students to comment on which
  transformations worked best and why.
* **Design and Coding Focus**: Have students :doc:`create a new dataset <custom_datasets>`
  (*e.g.*, your school logo or something that the student designs) and morph that into multiple
  target shapes. Ask students to comment on which transformations worked best and why.
* **Math and Coding Focus**: Have students create a custom shape (there will be a
  tutorial in the future) and try morphing a couple of the built-in datasets into that shape.
  Ask students to explain how they chose to calculate the shape and comment on which
  transformations worked best and why.

If you use Data Morph in your classroom, I would love to hear about it. Please
`send me a message <https://stefaniemolin.com/contact/>`_ detailing how you are using
it and how it goes.
