Data Morph in the classroom
---------------------------

Data Morph is intended to be used as a teaching tool to illustrate the importance
of data visualization. Here are some potential classroom activities for instructors:

* **Statistics Focus**: Have students pick one of the `built-in datasets
  <./api/data_morph.data.loader.html#data_morph.data.loader.DataLoader>`_,
  and morph it into all available `target shapes
  <./api/data_morph.shapes.factory.html#data_morph.shapes.factory.ShapeFactory>`_.
  Ask students to comment on which transformations worked best and why.
* **Creativity Focus**: Have students :doc:`create a new dataset <tutorials/custom-datasets>`
  (*e.g.*, your school logo or something that the student designs), and morph that into multiple
  `target shapes <./api/data_morph.shapes.factory.html#data_morph.shapes.factory.ShapeFactory>`_.
  Ask students to comment on which transformations worked best and why.
* **Math and Coding Focus**: Have students :doc:`create a custom shape <tutorials/shape-creation>`
  by inheriting from :class:`.LineCollection` or :class:`.PointCollection`, and try morphing a
  couple of the `built-in datasets <./api/data_morph.data.loader.html#data_morph.data.loader.DataLoader>`_
  into that shape. Ask students to explain how they chose to calculate the shape, and
  comment on which transformations worked best and why.

If you end up using Data Morph in your classroom, I would love to hear about it. Please
`send me a message <https://stefaniemolin.com/contact/>`_ detailing how you used it and
how it went.
