Data Morph.

Morph an input dataset of 2D points into select shapes, while preserving the summary
statistics to a given number of decimal points through simulated annealing. It is intended
to be used as a teaching tool to illustrate the importance of data visualization (see
`Data Morph in the classroom`_ for ideas).

Notes
-----
This code has been altered by Stefanie Molin to work for other input datasets
by parameterizing the target shapes with information from the input shape.
The original code works for a specific dataset called the "Datasaurus" and was created
for the paper *Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating Datasets with Varied Appearance and
Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing* by Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice
(ACM CHI 2017).

The paper and video can be found on the `Autodesk Research website
<https://www.research.autodesk.com/publications/same-stats-different-graphs-generating-datasets-with-varied-appearance-and-identical-statistics-through-simulated-annealing/>`_.
The version of the code placed on GitHub at
`jmatejka/same-stats-different-graphs <https://github.com/jmatejka/same-stats-different-graphs>`_,
served as the starting point for the Data Morph codebase, which is on GitHub at
`stefmolin/data-morph <https://github.com/stefmolin/data-morph>`_.
